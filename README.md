# TestGitAPI
Testing on git api calls. If the testing is failing then we have reached the max api limit for now.

Assignment:

This assignment will require that you write code to interface with an external REST-based APIs.   We could have used almost any external APIs, but for this assignment we chose GitHub because many of its APIs are public and do not require any authorization or API Keys. This simplifies both the use and setup.

Requirement:

You should write a function that will take as input a GitHub user ID. 
The output from the function will be a list of the names of the repositories that the user has, along with the number of commits that are in each of the listed repositories.
